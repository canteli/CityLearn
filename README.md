# CityLearn
CityLearn is an open source OpenAI Gym environment for the implementation of reinforcement learning (RL) for simulated demand response scenarios in buildings and cities.
![Demand-response](https://github.com/intelligent-environments-lab/CityLearn/blob/master/images/dr.jpg)
## Description
Districts and cities have periods of high demand for electricity, which raise electricity prices and the overall cost of the power distribution networks. Demand response is the coordination of the electricity consuming agents (i.e. buildings) in order to flatten the overall curve of electrical demand.
CityLearn allows the research community to explore the use of reinforcement learning to coordinate the electricity consumption in a district with multiple buildings by controlling the amount of stored energy in the summer period.

### Building
The heating and cooling demands of the buildings are obtained from [CitySim](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/leso/transfer/software/citysim/), a building energy simulator for urban scale analysis. Every building is instantiated by defining its associated energy supply and storage devices.
- Methods
  - ```state_space()``` and ```action_space()``` set the state-action space of each building
  - ```set_storage_heating()``` and ```set_storage_cooling()``` set the state of charge of the ```EnergyStorage``` device to the specified value and within the physical constraints of the system. Returns the total electricity consumption of the building at that time-step.
### Heat pump
The efficiency is given by the coefficient of performance (COP), which is calculated as a function of the outdoor temperature ```T_outdoorAir```, the technical efficiency of the heat pump ```eta_tech```, and the target temperatures ```T_target```.
Any amount of cooling demand of the building that isn't satisfied by the ```EnergyStorage``` device is automatically supplied by the ```HeatPump``` directly to the ```Building```. The ```HeatPump``` is more efficient (has a higher COP) if the outdoor air temperature ```s2``` is lower, and less efficient (lower COP) when the outdoor temperature is higher (typically during the day time). On the other hand, the demand for cooling in the building is higher during the daytime and lower at night. ```COP = cooling_energy_generated/electricity_consumed, COP > 1```
- Methods
  - ```get_max_cooling_power()``` and ```get_max_heating_power()``` compute the maximum amount of heating or cooling that the heat pump can provide based on its nominal power of the compressor and its COP. 
  - ```get_electric_consumption_cooling()``` and ```get_electric_consumption_heating()``` return the amount of electricity consumed by the heat pump for a given amount of supplied heating or cooling energy.
### Energy storage
Storage devices allow heat pumps to store energy that can be later released into the building. Typically every building will have its own storage device, but CityLearn also allows defining a single instance of the ```EnergyStorage``` for multiple instances of the class ```Building```, therefore having a group of buildings sharing a same energy storage device.
- Methods
  - ```charge()``` increases (+) or decreases (-) of the amount of energy stored. The input is the amount of energy as a ratio of the total capacity of the storage device (can vary from -1 to 1). Outputs the energy balance of the storage device.
## Environment variables
### States
- ```s1```: outdoor temperature in Celcius degrees. Same for every building for every time step. 
- ```s2```: hour of day (from 1 to 24). Same for every building for every time step. 
- ```s3```: state of the charge (SOC) of the energy storage device. From 0 (no energy stored) to 1 (at full capacity). It is different for every building and depends on the actions taken by each agent.
### Actions
- ```a```: increase (+) or decrease (-) of the amount of cooling energy stored in the energy storage device. Goes from -0.5 to 0.5 (attempts to decrease/increase the cooling energy stored in the storage device by an amount equivalent to 0.5 times its maximum capacity). In order to decrease the energy stored in the device, the energy must be released into the building. Therefore, the state of charge ```s3``` may not decrease by the same amount as the action ```a``` taken if the demand for cooling energy in the building is lower than ```a```.
### Reward
- ```r```: -cost of electricity. By default, it is proportional to the negative value of the cost function ```env.cost()```. The square term incentivizes the heat pumps to flatten the curve of demand instead of simply consuming less energy. See ```reward_function.py```, which contains a function that wraps the rewards obtained from the environment. The ```reward_function``` can be customized by the user in order to minimize the cost returned by the environment.
### Cost function
```env.cost()``` is the square of the total electricity consumption of all the buildings. Minimizing the ```env.cost()``` is achieved when the overall curve of electricity demand is flattened and reduced as much as possible.
## Additional functions
- ```building_loader(demand_file, weather_file, buildings)``` receives a dictionary with all the building instances and their respectives IDs, and loads them with the data of heating and cooling loads from the simulations.
- ```auto_size(buildings, t_target_heating, t_target_cooling)``` automatically sizes the heat pumps and the storage devices. It assumes fixed target temperatures of the heat pump for heating and cooling, which combines with weather data to estimate their hourly COP for the simulated period. The ```HeatPump``` is sized such that it will always be able to fully satisfy the heating and cooling demands of the building. This function also sizes the ```EnergyStorage``` devices, setting their capacity as 3 times the maximum hourly cooling demand in the simulated period.
## Multi-agent coordination
### One building
  - The optimal policy consists on storing cooling energy during the night (when the cooling demand of the building is low and the COP of the heat pump is higher), and releasing the stored cooling energy into the building during the day (high demand for cooling and low COP). 
### Multiple buildings
  - If controlled independently of each other and with no coordination, they will all tend to consume more electricity simultaneously during the same hours at night (when the COPs are highest), raising the price for electricity that they all pay at this time and therefore the electricity cost won't be completely minimized.
### Challenges 
1. Implement an independent RL agent for every building (this has already been done in this example) and try to minimize the scores in the minimum number of episodes for multiple buildings running simultaneously. The algorithm should be properly calibrated to maximize its likelyhood of converging to a good policy (the current example does not converge 100% of the times it is run). 
2. Coordinate multiple decentralized RL agents or a single centralized agent to control all the buildings. The agents could share certain information with each other (i.e. ```s3```), while other variables (i.e. ```s1``` and ```s2```) are aleady common for all the agents. The agents could decide which actions to take sequentially and share this information whith other agents so they can decide what actions they will take. Pay especial attention to whether the environment (as seen by every agent) follows the Markov property or not, and how the states should be defined accordingly such that it is as Markovian as possible.
